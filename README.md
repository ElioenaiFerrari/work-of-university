## This code does not follow architectural or design standards, it is only for college work.

### Setup

run `yarn` for install dependencies, and run `yarn start:dev` for run in development mode

_there is no script for production, as it is only for didactic purposes_

the script `yarn db:setup` will help you drop, create and migrate your database

Thanks :D
